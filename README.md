# QuPath General Scripts

This is a series of scripts we have built over time based on our needs and the needs of our users.

These work with QuPath 0.2.x and will be kept up to date with the latest versions of QuPath.

## About The Scripts
As these are all rather independent and likely to change and move over time, we will not create a readme but rather encourage you to read the header of each script, which should contain a description of what the script does and how to use it. 

# Licensing 

All scripts here are probably too simple to copyright and release under a certain license, so unless explicitely specified, they are considered 
CC0, or public. We are happy to be thanked if you found the code useful :).
